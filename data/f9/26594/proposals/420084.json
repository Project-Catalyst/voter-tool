However, Catalyst GPS is a promising tool/framework already created by the catalyst community, and it is well suited for this proposal to offer a solution to Blockchain4Good. Funding this initiative will also help to refine, test, and develop this framework with Blockchain4good as a great case study. The member organizations of blockchain4good each have a large reach and will help to bring exposure to Cardano by working together to multiply their collective impact. I would also suggest the team focus on delivering specific tools that the wider community can access and use, so as to align this project with the challenge goals.

They have successfully delivered results with their work on Catalyst in the past, and are capable of delivering on this proposal.

This will create a powerful team of Cardano community members with wide ranging skills and abilities and proven track records.

Governing structures, notably DAOs are theoretically complex organizations that require a great deal of thought, collaboration, communication and constant feedback. On the surface, the proposal is very interesting and clearly aligns with the challenge setting. Upon closer inspection, the incredible work done by their member organizations shows great promise within the framework of a decentralized decision making body. From supporting sustainable agriculture to financing and building green homes in Africa, and including the visionary World Mobile, the Cardano Foundation, and others, the ability of a DAO housing these members could be limitless. Creating the perfect conceptual structure to enhance these already highly impactful programs is a venture well worth investing in.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The core team behind this proposal have a combined skill set that is optimum for success. Between Tomi, Nadia and Ondrej, you have a wealth of experience in Catalyst, business admin, economics, agile development, project management and development and much more. In addition to the participating organizations mentioned prior, Cardashift, Immunify Life, Waya Collective are some of the other programs invested in this project.

The proposal could have been more specific in terms of how it plans to meet the challenge goals as it does  not seem to be creating or developing a tool for DAOs, but utilizing an existing tool.
