Conducting this research by a Cardano experts team can show case how Cardano can be the best blockchain for decentralized governance processes that overcome the one coin=one vote limitation, and help achieving the challenge KPI - more DAOs, more communities and more ADA used. \n\nOne thing that is missing from the proposal solution is integrating or collaborating with the Atala PRISM project, as its goals are to provide digital identity solutions on Cardano, which can be align with this proposal goals.

It aims at designing a platform to issue SSI (verified by smart contracts) to verify an account/ user to be a unique human. This is done by issuing a SSI verifiable credential, this will be done by adding user to encrypted list to block chain via DApp. The SSI credential will be added to an account/wallet and thus verifies the account to be Human owned and unique.\n\nThis is similar to CA issuing the SSL certificates to websites on the internet, except that the CA stores the data of the users on their servers in data centers, here the user data will be stored on a Block chain through a DApp in an encrypted list. Instead of Renewal of Certificate, the user will have to verify his identity periodically\n\nThis feature is essential for any DAO, including the Cardano community. In the past there has been increase in the user-base of Cardano's Project Catayst, it has also been noticed that there was suspicion of same user having multiple accounts, and the community had to put-in extra effort to verify the identities. As it is comparably a small community for now, other mitigation steps could be implemented but, as the community grows it becomes impossible to use the same methods. Hence this is a very good project proposal, by the time it is implemented a the Cardano community would have grown considerably and would be available at its disposal at the right time. This model can also be used other projects to verify human identity.\n\nThe risks are appropriately listed: 1) If all the concepts of SSI work together 2) If you can find experts in the field to work at the price-per-hour affordable by the community as most of experts are paid very well currently. The community coders may have to review white paper, contribute as a philanthropic project for the good of the community and then go for implementation through an expert with much less work to be done.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Plan spans 6 months for delivery, i.e., Jan 2023.\nPlatform proposed : Plutus\nTeam: 4 (1 Lead, 1 Product Manager, 1 Cryptographer, 1 Plutus Developer)\n\nThe team size could have been reduced to 3 as Product Manager could have take the role of Full Stack lead as well.

This especially in other blockchain ecosystems, as for example, I leave you this link (https://bit.ly/3oMHJIf). Cardano is still in its infancy with respect to the entire ecosystem of DAOs. Although in general Cardano has a different approach to development than other ecosystems, we are definitely not immune to situations like these being replicated. For this reason, it is necessary to dedicate special efforts to mitigate in the most effective way the possibility of occurrence of these events. In this particular case, the DAO coders team raises the need to offer to the community a one-member one-vote governance method that is resistant to Sybil attacks, and for that purpose they request a budget to conduct research on the matter. The main objective is to verify, in a decentralized way, that a given member of a community is human, unique and alive. Allowing to store that information encrypted in the blockchain as an alternative to storage in centralized databases, which is what is being used in other ecosystems. The result of this project will be a whitepaper whose content will be open to the community, so it can be used by any DAO that requires it. Although this challenge is not focused on research, it can be understood that the result of this research could be the basis for the development of future tools that could have a great impact on the community.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Due to the intrinsic characteristics of this proposal, having a core team with the necessary knowledge to carry out this research is essential. Unfortunately, the approach proposed by the DAO coders is to hire developers specialized in SSI and Cryptography. Fortunately, the team identifies this situation as one of the main risks of the project, and proposes countermeasures to mitigate it. The profiles of the members of DAO Coders are public and with relevant experience for the purpose of the proposal. The implementation plan is divided into time periods of months and in each month there is a brief description of the different work packages that make up the project, due to the characteristics of the proposal, the proposed actions are simple to understand and make sense for the achievement of the objective. The budget is comprised entirely of the professional fees of the people in charge of the research. The amounts for the Product Manager and Lead Developer are partially added, which in general seem to me to be adequate.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Due to the nature of the proposal, it is perfectly feasible to be able to audit the proposal since the white paper is expected to be published in January 2023. This itself represents the metric of success of the proposal, so it makes sense and allows the community to determine if it was successful or not. The proposed roadmap is concise and easy to understand, as are the intended deliverables for each time period. Lastly, as a general recommendation for the team on this project with so many moving parts, and as a way to bring more transparency into this DAO-NET ecosystem. I would expect for future funding, that the team would submit detailed progress on all funded proposals through whatever channel they see fit (beyond the report submitted to IOG).

It is about carrying out research that will generate a Whitepaper regarding how DAOs can verify if the SSIs of new people who have a relationship with the group are in fact human and unique individuals. I think it is something that is really necessary, because as our blockchain grows, it is expected that processes will become more and more digital, automated and powered by artificial intelligence.
