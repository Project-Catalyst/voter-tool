It is about creating a food delivery dApp that also corresponds to a DAO, the intention is to streamline decentralized management and provide benefits for customers and intermediaries, while using our blockchain technologies. This will certainly meet the objectives of the challenge, since at the same time a new DAO will be founded, enabling the specific KPIs of the challenge such as \u201cnumber of Communities engaged in collaboration using Cardano DAO creation tools + amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees after the solutions on this challenge get implemented (> than the challenge's allocated fund amount) + number of DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months\u201d are met. The proponents explain in a very long and detailed way how this new integration they will create would be: a business model, products and services will be made based on the use of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts; allowing digital tokens (I believe CNFTs) to be used by companies while marketing their products and services to customers - from what I understand the tokens would be rewards. The explanations go on and on, detailing, for example, that the protocol created would be done with the aim of establishing a direct partnership with different types of customers/companies, such as restaurants and couriers; my question was more in the sense of how these companies and their teams would learn to use Cardano's technologies, so that they can take advantage of the B2B technology being created, with all its efficiency and automation and so on. But the proposal is very impressive.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponents do not provide such a detailed roadmap, they state that there will be a total time of 27 weeks for the development of the project and they specify what would happen in certain periods, as we can see in the excerpt \u201capproximately 15 weeks to develop and produce high level specifications and develop, register and unregister restaurants, process orders and payments, prepare for audit.\u201d The problems here are: 1) we don't have a good idea about temporality, 5 weeks is almost 4 months, what would happen in each month? The activities to be developed are just mentioned, they are not explained in a good degree of detail, it would be necessary to delve deeper into what would be done, how the smart contracts would be developed and so on. For these reasons, the script only allows us to have an ok preview of what will be done, without as solid an understanding as I would like. As for the costs, the project asks for a financing of 22,400 dollars, and this amount is divided into some parts, such as the payment of the Plutus/Haskell developers (a value of 80 dollars per hour is requested, which is a reasonable amount and within what we see on the market today, and also in other Catalyst proposals). Other part of the funding is split towards UX/UI designer salaries, research, implementation and etc. However, it is not so clear how much each professional will earn outside the developers, would the designers receive 40 dollars an hour? What would be the payment of the project manager, and the professional responsible for marketing? The values \u200b\u200bget a little confusing. Finally, talking about the team, I thought that this part of the feasibility is very good, because we know a little summary about who the professionals involved are and also their experiences, including what kind of relationship they have with Cardano (for example, Samuel is developer on the Emurgo project). So, yes, trust is passed on the team. In general, the proposal is viable, deserving only a few improvements in specific points.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of progress is very good. Proposers let us know what the internal organization of the team would look like (\u201cThe Munchy GO team will meet 2-3 times a week depending on workflows, combining asana and slack apps to assign and report tasks and work goals. Align entries and exits across the team\u201d); other than that we also know that monthly reports will be produced, their content being defined as \u201csummaries of project progress, the reports will provide key points related to milestones and timelines and will be publicly available on a monthly basis\u201d. From what is said, we conclude that these reports will be more focused on the processes themselves (activities and work routines), but also some partial results will be addressed, from what I understand, the proponents exemplify that progress can be measured by some KPIs such as \u201cRestaurant Partnerships; Postal partnerships; Users on board; Calculation of protocol fees and impact in traditional on-demand food delivery applications;\u201d. In other words, when it comes to monitoring the development process, we are very well placed. Regarding the final results, the proponents also detail very richly what the levels of successful adoption would be like, exemplifying what the first, second and third levels would be. I believe there is a bit of a lack of attention to how Cardano would benefit directly, for example how we could measure the number of active members growing after the dApp was launched. It is also not so clear how all this information would reach our community, would there be some presentation in townhall, a written report containing a final research? I believe that as well as feasibility, the topic is good, but not perfect.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5267, "q0": "The Munchy Go Delivery Food dApp DAO proposal is to build a decentralised on demand food app. They will use tokens to monetize products and services and provide voting tools to their users. Their stakeholders are restaurants, couriers and everyone who use on demand delivery food apps.

The team has provided the links for their telegram, clear contracts and mlabs in the proposal. The proposal addresses the DAO love Cardano challenge well in the sense that their dApp will focus on token utilty and creating vote function to minimize centralized management team. The solution will provide use case to replace traditional business model like on demand delivery food app and bring more people to Cardano. Although the the Munchy Go team could have provided the real world example or user experience from start to finish in using their dApp to explain their points better. The example of this is the proposal mention integrating their MVP with restaurants and courier apps via direct partnership. However, it would have been better to say what would be the experience of one user from start to finish. Where do they go first (partner app?) then where could they find Munch Go MVP? It is important to show also what the user will vote on with their voting tool. The team still has not provided the flow of transactions and how users interact with DAO features to convince and make the user case more probable. The team describe the potential risk as plutocracies (concentration of voting power in hand of the few) and says that incremental voting would fix this issue.

The team also has not supplied the online profile of team member although they explain the involvement of team member in catalyst. They plan to get support from Catalyst and Cardashift for this occasion and hope that their DAO would be self-sufficient and generate enough revenue.

Second level is for the Munchy Go to ramp up early crypto adopters and Third level is leading mobile app rival the traditional on demand delivery food apps. The team could have provided the community with the online links where to track the progress of project ie. official website and where those monthly report & development reports can be found. As of now, the team only supplies telegram link with no official website. The other 2 links they provided belong to Mlab and clearcontracts and the community cannot track their updates from those websites.

By providing a new service that offers the same service at a low cost, will surely attract more and more people (businesses, couriers and customers). Each of these stakeholders would pay less when the Much Go Delivery will be operational.\nCurrently other traditional are offering the service at 33% service fee, but with Munchy Go App this amount will decrease to a max  of 5%.

Another element to point out, the service will paid after completion compared to the current one's that charge upfront.\nThose two major differences are important for the success of this initiative, while it's feasible as the team has already started working on the token and formed with a large experience and expertise in the field.\nThe budget is reasonable covering important expenses items with details.\n5 star is my rating for this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team is planning on publishing reports everytime they meet, but also every monthly report on project progress.\nThe mechanism of people the progress will be the Catalyst community social media platform.\nKPI's are well defined in  different stages focusing on the application adoption by the restaurants, couriers and customers.\nSeems to be a clear mechanism for audit.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2458", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3672, "q0": "This project wants to create a decentralized food delivery app. This would give greater ownership and a voice to stakeholders like restaurant owners and delivery drivers for this particular use case. This team made 2 proposals across different fund challenges, this for building out the DAO side and another for building the dApp itself. But it is unclear what the benefit to the broader DAO ecosystem on Cardano is, beyond having a DAO vote on a food delivery app. I stress this point as the funds are indicated to be used for building smart contracts to facilitate voting with tokens which many teams are already doing even in previous funds and the broader Cardano ecosystem, one can do a simple search for it and reuse the components they have built rather than waste resources doing the same thing. If the current DAO tools are insufficient, the team should point out these areas and offer to contribute or improve existing tools/projects or at least show that the current teams are unwilling to take their feedback into account, thus creating a need for the team to build voting contracts from scratch. Nonetheless, it is up to the voters to decide if $22,400 is worth it for the DAO part of this food delivery dApp as the other proposal by the same team requested for more than $100,000 to build out the dApp itself.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Building out the DAO seems feasible as the team has many years of experience with software engineering in general and more specifically Haskell and Plutus, plus their partnerships with Clear Contracts and Mlabs should help them with most obstacles that they might encounter. 2 months is ample time to implement the DAO aspects or maybe too much especially if they are just reusing already existing components from other teams or projects.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team will publish their meeting minutes after a short delay and also release monthly reports which seems to be quite detailed ranging from the dApp\u2019s usage statistics and code.
