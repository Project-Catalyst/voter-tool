The proposal communicates a solution to make DAO decision-making mechanisms more efficient. The OPEN-SOURCED nature of the proposal means that prospective organizations will have the tools necessary to thoroughly examine the features available on Cardano. These tools to organize community actions do not yet exist on Cardano. The proposal also took the time to highlight all the hallmarks of a person-centered project by putting emphasis on privacy, verifiability and many other factors important to the human users of these types of tools. This proposal is exciting. \n\nI want to highlight that the proposal\u2019s communicated scope means that it will not DIRECTLY satisfy one of the campaign measures to increase the amount of transaction fees coming from DAO actions. But this should be celebrated.  And it should be noted that it can actually lead to way more participation, way more opportunities to vote, and therefore way more transaction fees (indirectly) related to DAO activities. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on what the proposer has communicated I strongly believe that the proposal is likely to be successfully implemented, and that the proposer has ample ability to solve the problems identified.

There is a comprehensive budget outline that is broken out into appropriate terms that seem reasonable to achieve the goals. The proposal gives us a very ambitious timeline to complete the work (three months), but I believe the team is more than capable of delivering on this for the community. The proposal takes time to clearly explain the technical aspects that are crucial for implementation, all of which will be shared openly with the community. Finally, the proposer provides more than sweat equity, but informs the community that the team will also contribute monetary funds towards delivering on this project. It is highly likely that this proposal will be successful and bring real utility to the Cardano community in a short order of time.

The proposal does a great job if reinforcing the fact that the technical development will be observable and open sourced for the community to audit and even re-use. This is great. It goes on to explain that the findings from research phase will also be shared, and a survey conducted. This makes the entire process responsive to the inputs of the Cardano community.

Even if off-chain voting isn't the answer for every governance model, having it as an option for DAOs will likely be valuable. \n\nWhile the Impact statements are sufficient as is, a few minor details could be improved. \"Astonishing security properties\" in the problem statement is a vague statement. Astonishing in what way? Good? Bad? Perplexing? I'd also like to see a deeper exploration of the need for both verifiability and receipt-freeness, since on the surface level those two goals seem to be at odds with each other. It doesn't need to be technical, but a 10,000 ft. view of how one might allow a vote to be verified for the voter, but not verifiable by a third party would be illuminating. \n\nFinally, while I appreciate the team's confidence--and they do have reason to be confident given their history--I am a little surprised to see no risks assessed for the project.

Right now, we see some budding DAOs like Gimbalabs and littlefish emerging, and MuesliSwap plan to create the open-source off-chain solution specifically tailored for this kind of process. In my opinion, this comes at the right time, as MuesliSwap have proven themselves with their order-book style DEX that has proven more robust and user-friendly than many AMM-style alternatives. Throwing their experience with complex smart contract and on-chain development into the ring is a great place to start, even if the end result needs more teams to build on it.

I also find it amazing that high quality teams like MLabs and Muesli can offer their work cheaper than many totally unproven proposals with white label development or freelancers, but if this is the case then I think it is great for us.

After the 150 hour research phase the team will publish the findings in a \"survey paper\", sharing their initial ideas about possible mechanism designs. After that an evaluation for implementation will be discussed pro/con style. This sounds reasonable and a great way to gradually share findings and progress. As the team is exposed via their DEX, social media and interviews with the community, this information and the rest of the proposal provide enough ways and info to audit the progress and hopefully result in a fruitful, back-and-forth implementation process instead of a \"take it or leave it\" approach by many development teams who prefer to go it alone.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2688", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6183, "q0": "DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a decentralized autonomous organization, by applying rules coded in code, we can operate independently without the intervention of People.

Thus, the issues proposed by the team are consistent with the goal of the Challenge: to provide tools and improve the operational efficiency of the DAO. At the same time, the issue raised has also solved some of the Challenge's questions: open source chain to conduct elections, increase DAO tools (off-chain), attract Cardano users. Thus, your proposal has been towards Developing solid, quality, reliable and sustainable infrastructure, expanding infrastructure and improving technology to provide modern energy services. and sustainable for all, empowering and promoting social, economic and political inclusion for all. Therefore, the proposal can be scaled up in the future to bring positive benefits to the community for sustainable development. This concept proposal bridges the gap between the theoretical results and the respective implementations developed specifically for the Cardano ecosystem (i.e. participation via Cardano wallet). All resulting tools will be made open source, with such infrastructure essential for a community-managed ecosystem that is thriving as it enters a new era of the platform. truly democratic and decentralized, while aiming to bring the best features of the voting mechanisms known to cryptographers (and in many cases the best they can be) into the Cardano ecosystem. This also allows any project with open source access to implement high-quality voting which will give a huge boost to the community governance of many projects in the ecosystem. Cardano <3 DAO and DAO <3 secure election. The way of bringing ideas, introducing the positive effects of ideas to the sustainable development of the community, is logically argued by the proposed group. In the process of implementing the idea you determine that there is no risk. And the reason given by the team is: having a large development team, not having to face the risks of leaving developers. However, I would like to have you explain more about the security of the DAO that you have done.

A few examples of some properties given are privacy, integrity, and verifiability. Not only do they explain why those properties would be useful, but also why an off chain solution is useful.
