Good proposal and impact on the challenge posed. Here, the team is working to create a Catalyst Swarm Bounty Board system to support and reward Community contributions and engagement. Catalyst Swarm is using the Dework Platform (w3 platform, now a bridge to Ethereum Blockchain) for project management & Bounty Table. Dework can be used to develop Bounty Table on Cardano Blockchain. The team has set key goals here that show that the team's expertise and preparation for what needs to be done is great, knowing what to do and how to build on those goals and achieve them. get them. goals that the group wants to develop. At the same time, the author has given many examples, describes how Swarm checks and discovers the Bonus including, events, roles and processes, and provides specific links so we can learn about it. what the group presented. In addition, the team recognized the risks and had solutions to minimize risks when the project was deployed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\nThe proposal team outlined a very clear and detailed plan for the project. Milestones are set over 3 quarters along with operational events. According to the proposal presented, the Catalyst Swarm Bounty Board is up and running and further developed and tested on the Dework Platform and completed in Q2. The project roadmap is implemented nowr Q3 and Q4/2022 with each job to be done is analyzed and explained in depth. With the plan sheet provided, we know all that will be done and in what time period. Next is the budget. The proposal requires a budget of $73,600. The team provided a clear budget table for each specific job such as: salaries of experts, bonuses, treasury, accounting, etc., calculated at the rate of money/hour/work/month(4 month). Grants are allocated to each specific work to be done on the project in a reasonable manner and in agreement with the requested budget. As shown, the Catalyst Swarm Bounty Board project is a collaboration of several experienced and engaged teams from the Catalyst Community. In addition, the proposal introduced each member who will participate and be responsible for and perform work in the project. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, we have attached the link files so that we can know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal presented. Overall, the proposed plan is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced. Proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\nThe team cares a lot about this part of the proposal. The team provides metrics to measure project development and management progress on Catalyst Swarm Dework & Discord, and on the Swarm Bounty Catalog. Transactions and payments through the Treasury Foundation's accounting & treasury systems on Discord, Github, and Gitbook. At the same time, the team provides links records so that we can easily audit them accurately and continuously. Since we are provided with a lot of information, in my opinion the necessary and satisfactory information is established. We know the goals to be achieved, the benefits it will bring to the community and the Cardano ecosystem. I think if funded, the proposal will be ready to be audited from the first minute. And the end product is the success of the project. A bonus system is developed. Massive community involvement in open projects and tasks. Create Blueprints & Playbooks and support projects that build DAO & DAO tools for the Cardano Ecosystem. Besides, detailed roadmap, members with enough skills will spend a lot of time and professional experience to successfully complete the work in the project on schedule. Detailed budget transparency.

In that sense the creation of a better set of tools to accomplish this would be very impactful for the community and certainly make DAOs better in many ways. The problem which this proposal is trying to solve is well defined and the creation of new DAO tools fits very well with the challenge and meets the set goals without question. Several examples are given as to the benefit of bounty boards and how they could be used to improve DAO operations. With that said the proposal is light on details as to what precise changes they are looking to integrate into the new tools. The notion of integrating the system with treasuries is highlighted and performance of rewarding multiple parties for various types of engagement, even distribution of NFT tokens, but it would have been better to see specifics. As the proposal stands it seems to be more about researching the best use cases than actual tool production. If this is an incorrect assessment then I would suggest to the author to add specifics such as, eg: creation of smart contract X to link funds in treasury escrow fund to bounty board on completion of task Y. Even without such specifics however, the earnest look into how to best utilize these tools would be of benefit to the community and worth the funds requested in terms of returns. I agree the answer covers most of the criteria and that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal is very interesting in the sense that it relies on several different sources to contribute to the completion of the project. Many of those sources happen to be themselves decentralized organizations. The sources that are listed are well known in the community and individuals listed have many of the skills that you would expect to manage a project. There is no information however about who specifically would be managing the project or who would be assigned what tasks. The assumption here is that this would be likely coordinated through Swarm Labs but this makes assessing credentials of individuals working on proposals difficult. The proposal has clear timelines and a budget broken down into different areas of work. The details of that work however are lacking. For example the largest part of the funding is dedicated to the dev team to develop improvements and features to the Bounty Board system. In order to assess if this funding is reasonable it would be important to see what improvements specifically. Perhaps the proposal team could add such information as; How much coding will be required? What type of devs will be needed and will smart contracts be involved?...etc. As a community I would hope that we all would like the idea of having more decentralized organizations taking on these types of tasks without knowing the individuals that will be specifically tasked with the work but overall for the purpose of this assessment I have to say that I neither agree nor disagree that the project plans and budget supplied is feasible to deliver.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a roadmap with timelines. There is also a specific place to visit to check on progress which is great to see and something that many other proposals lack. The question however is what specific milestones would you be able to check on? The KPIs are all qualitative in nature with no specific numbers or defined metrics attached. The only verifiable components would be to check if other communities have implemented bounty boards but how would you measure if those are an improvement? What technical changes can we hope to see and how do we measure the new community involvement created in a quantitative way? This would not need to be complicated. For example success could be measured by 10+ tasks accomplished using the bounty board of organization Y. Unfortunately no such metrics were submitted therefore I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2113", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1564, "q0": "The Catalyst swarm is a vital part of the Catalyst community that is very important towards empowering and catalyzing its impact driven aspects and that gives a lot of democratic empowerment and sense of belonging to the community.

For all of these reasons they are incredibly impactful and valuable towards the Cardano ecosystem. For this concrete proposal, I can acertain that a pilot of the proposed project is already existing and used by several users, including myself. It not just provides various work opportunities where different community members can bring in their skills beyond assessing etc. and where also assessments for proposals finished ahead of submission deadline can be made to streamline catalyst processes more. I am sure improving and professionalizing this tool will be increadibly impactful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For anyone knowing the swarm operations not much needs to be said about feasibility: They have a lot of stuff organized, including the mentioned dework platform that they are now seeking to extend.

It is therefore possible to consider the Catalyst SWARM forum as the tool that is creating a DAO, training in governance strategies, and managing DAO activities. These are important stepping stones for the DAO phase that the campaign brief anticipates.

This intrigues me because it brings a new form of utility to the Cardano blockchain and Project Catalyst members. The team plans to build a bounty board. This would allow users in the Cardano ecosystem to view the \"public tasks\" that are listed and complete them in order to receive a reward. This would be beneficial to those in the community that want to participate, but don't know where to go. They will be rewarded as well. The challenge of this proposal is that Cardano and Catalyst need more ways to have more engagement in their communities. Especially in the form of a DAO that could be rewarding to users. By creating a DAO tool that will include this bounty board will likely incentivize lots of users to participate in the DAO. This has the capability of introducing more community members to learn more about DAOs and to become a part in a great decentralized community by helping complete these tasks.

When auditing the potential likelihood of success for a proposal, there are several things that should be considered. One of these concepts is transparency. When the team at Catalyst Swarm is completely open with their community members, there is room for trust to be built. This is important because it leads to trust within both groups. This often leads to greater engagement from the community and develops community members that are educationally invested in the project or in this case, the proposed idea to create a DAO that rewards users. After the trust has been established, there comes room for accountability. The community will allow the project to be open with the community and in this case, with a DAO, they will have voting power. They will feel like they have an opinion and that they get validated instead of their thought being tossed out.

With that kind of capability, the scaling that could be done for large DAO's would be absolutely mind blowing.
