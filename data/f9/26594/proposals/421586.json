Building it to support an existing project, which could be considered a DAO, is also a good idea. Having a tool for managing endowment of an organisation would definitely benefit DAO ecosystem. Having already application for the tool is definitely a plus. It could evolve into a novel way of funding charity work. Having at least one physical shelter provide input ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the problem statement and proposed solution were very clear, feasibility part is not. It's hard to envision what the end product would look like. It's hard to figure out how long will certain parts take, it can be calculated from rates, but number don't make much sense. There seem to be logical contradictions in the plan.\nStep one is supposed to last 2 weeks. I don't think it's realistic. Remote character of work. number of organisations to be contacted and work that would be necessary don't correspond to estimated 2 weeks. It also seems some of this work could have been done beforehand (establishing contact with at least several DAOs). Goals in this part could also be more specific, for example, questions that the group would need to answer. There are no funds marked for UI/UX design and development, it would help to clarify what exactly needs to be built. Moreover as a tool for non-technical people it would benefit from good user interface. Large part of the budget (20%) is marked towards funding the ShelterPets project. While other parts have clear deliverables and will be spent to have work done, the endowment funding is given without any continuation/exit scenarios. I know this project intends to investigate legal aspects, so maybe that's why this part is missing, maybe a smaller amount would be better to run a proof of concept endowment. If the endowment can't be lower, then it would be good to provide a reason for the specific amount and provide a clear, even if simple, framework of how the funds would be controlled.\nThere are no funds reserved for marketing.\nThis seems like work that requires more than one person, considering the budget. Single person team is also a significant risk that is not mentioned in impact part. Building a team of 2-3 people before hand would be advisable\n\nI think this project is too broad and complex, maybe splitting it into several proposals would help to keep the complexity down.\nFor example, one proposal geared towards organizations expectations and legal aspects, second (next fund) implementation of tools and MVP deployment.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It is clear what the project aims to achieve.

I see no problems with scalability, as an open standard like the one that is supposed to be created here should easily be applicable to many usecases.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is transparent about himself and has already finished a working project and demonstrated some skills there. The proposers Github indicates that they have some of the skills required to implement the proposal. The budget is explained and reasonable, and some of the resources that will be used are mentioned and explained. A discussion of possible risks with mitigation strategies exists. The tasks are only defined on a very high level and a proper implementation plan is not yet presented. Also, a proposal team is unfortunately not yet assembled. In the current environment with a lack of trained people in relation to the ecosystem's current growth this might present a serious hurdle.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While the problem and solution description are generally clear and enable auditing of the general deliverables, a more fine-grained, time-bound roadmap is missing in order to enable auditability throughout execution of the project plan.

The solution to this is to develop a framework that DAOs can use to deploy and manage funding-style funds or treasuries on Cardano using staking returns to provide funding for needs. the demand of the DAO. The output of this solution will be a pre-built framework that any DAO can use to set up and manage funding that leverages the power of POS. This will be achieved through the use of tools such as Round Table (by ADAO), Fixed Portal (by ADAO), governance token minting, chain governance through AGORA, and more.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a framework that can be implemented and built by any organization looking to leverage funding and use proof of concept ShelterPets Endowment (which is a project that works from the animal charity on Cardano!). Thus, this solution could have a big impact by making these types of funds more viable, driving use cases like charities, scholarships, and more. Looking at this proposal, I can only say that it fits the challenge completely. A clear and understandable solution was provided in the proposal to clearly describe the problem targeted", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is very detailed, we understand the phases of the project and what each sub-task will include, forming a very clear and explored order. It would be great if the proponent said how long each of these activities will take on average, in what month it is expected to get such partial results, and so on. Next is the budget, which is pretty well explained. The project cost is divided into 4 parts: Educational/writing, Tooling development, Legal inquiries, and Endowment Funding. In each of these sections, we understand very well where the funds will be invested. So in my opinion, the required amount of $50,000 is completely appropriate.\nFinally, the project team, this part does not seem to be very good. This proposal has only been proposed by Trevor Wilson, we know he will be the leader of this project, but we do not have enough information about him. Regarding relevant experience, mentioned as the founder of ShelterPets, a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace. Extensive academic and research background and experience developing and running an NFT project from scratch. We know his affiliation and where we can learn more directly about the work he has developed in the past. The remaining members are referred to as \"Additional team members will be sought after for their experience with charities, legal background, passion for animals, and full-stack developers.\" We need to present the correct name, their role of them in their project, professional resume, and associate profile. So I think the feasibility here is ok, but the team part needs to add more details about his team members", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Having a clear KPI in place will make it easy to track progress such as:\n-GitHub commits and publishes open-source code/resources\n-Disclosure of detailed information on the legal aspects of grants controlled by DAOs\n-Successful implementation of ShelterPets Endowment as a proof of concept. The end goal is the successful implementation of ShelterPets as an Endowment-based DAO charity. This means that ShelterPets can provide financial support to shelters through chain governance.

This model could be later used by other DAOs, charity and non charity oriented, and by that the proposal could help achieve the challenge goals and increase the usability of Cardano for DAOs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It seems that the proposers has good knowledge about the emerging DAOs ecosystem that is been building on Cardano. This knowledge and acquaintance can be very helpful in creating collaboration, implementing tooling and infrastructures and evolving their project with the rest of the ecosystem. \n\nHowever I see two weak points in this proposal: managing treasury on a stake pool means exposure to the volatility of ADA price in dollar (or other fiat currencies). Organization expense are usually in fiat, and dependency on ADA rewords can create a risk to the organization operation. Explanation about how the proposer plan to mitigate this risk is missing. \n\nThe second is the need for a technical skilled personal in the team. Smart contract developers and stake pool operators are at shortage all across the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal can recruit new team members if and after they will get the funding, but it would have been more reassuring if they already have got the needed team member to start form.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers provided plan and budget breakdown, and measurable indicators.

One concern is that the additional team member positions have not been filled yet, but Trevor have announced that these will be sought after once funded. There is also room for making the plan and milestones section even better by providing a more detailed timeline of what dates certain parts of the project are expected to be completed on.

What exactly is needed on the way to achieve success? What metrics, how to measure them, what numbers do we want to achieve at certain points in time, and how do we track them?
