I\u2019m not sure if they really pay poorly instructors and pollute the ecosystem with cheap materials with little pedagogical quality. But there is definitely a space for fair competition - and crypto industry can bring this competition. In this particular case  - with project Catalyst and DAO. Cryptocurrencies would perfectly fit the Ed-Tech area of the internet as during the times of crisis (be it economical or Covid) people tend to learn more cheaply (as learning by private classes in the real life is much more expensive) and there is a definite need to make payments and cash out (for tutors, course creators). Educational market itself can bring cryptocurrencies to a new level and Cardano should lead this movement. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has done amazing job in research.

It could be a platform for emerging communities that got shared fields of expertise to learn from each other.\n\nHowever this proposal does not addresses the challenge directly. The challenge is for building tools, infrastructures and services to DAOs on Cardano, not for building a new DAO. If this was the case, then the scope of this challenge was huge, as almost every initiative can organized as a DAO (instead of LLC or NGO).

The video you make about poli is also easy to understand and vivid, I find the video design beautiful. You also include funny pictures to help read the proposal not to be boring. You give an example of equal opportunity that is easy to understand, from which I see that building an e-learning DAO is very necessary. You guys describe how revenue streams are distributed also very vividly by designing diagrams to make it easier for people to understand. The list of 15 largest EdTech companies in the world is clearly listed by you, there are 2 access links, I have checked and verified that it is correct as you have given.

The importance and future significance of e-Learning is clearly researched for the article, and personally, as an educator in face-to-face schools for the last 18+ years I can attest to the need for better and more e-Learning solutions to reach populations that currently don\u2019t have the means and access to specific education. I tend to disagree with the proposers opinions about current e-Learning platforms, for example they labeled Cousera as \u2018evil,\u2019 there are indeed several solid, free, online e-Learning platforms that are highly recognized. The interesting addition to this open-source learning platform could be the integration of fairer revenue sharing, including the earn-to-learn aspects described in their separate \u2018BOUNDER\u2019 proposal. \nA strong impact related point that resonates with me is the chance to achieve equal opportunities through open-source e-Learning. The example they give about having to pay $65,000 for an Advanced Management Program, as opposed to the possibility of free online courseware is promising. Mentioned throughout the proposal is that there would need to be a way of ensuring certification is equally comparable, this would be vital for students who then hope to gain employment after the training. I can see how it is possible through the Cardano ecosystem and blockchain technology, however, it would take a massive shake in societal understanding and company requirements, even with possibly some resentment and attacks from establishments that would no longer receive their exorbitant funding. How would your e-Learning DAO certification blockchain compare with the societal \u2018prestige\u2019 of getting a degree from Havard?\nThat being said, if reputation, consistency and certification can be ensured, I am certain that there will be a significant uptake in students willing to study quality courses online. Learning from the experiences of COVID, many students and schools have rethought traditional teaching models and this is the perfect time to enter the online learning sphere.\nOverall, the possible impact on the Cardano community is solid, I rate it 4 stars.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Online learning platforms have come and go, those that stick around need a strong financial mechanism, decent content and many repeat customers. This proposal plans to enter an already \u2018flooded\u2019 market, particularly with the offerings being developed since COVID, however, they have the chance to stand out with their learn-to-earn model.\nThe proposers list the risk of not finding coders to work on the program, or not being granted the money - I think moreover the biggest risk is not investing enough in partnerships and marketing, which they have briefly mentioned. \nAs with their other proposals, this team puts forward a detailed and realistic \u2018action plan\u2019 to show the funders each stage of the project. The timeline is only six months, which may be a little ambitious particularly integrating the payment, revenue and wallet systems in the final phase. I think before launching there needs to be a serious content collation time, it\u2019s a nice idea to launch a perfectly functioning open-source e-Learning platform with full features, however, to actually have 10-15-20 courses already \u2018certifiable\u2019 and ready to go will speed up the launch. Perhaps this is planned and I haven\u2019t quite understood the deployment description.\nThe staffing required and identified are solid, with approximate salaries and months of work required to complete. The proposal gives details of the current people who are fully invested in this product, and experts they will recruit at stages of the development through Github.\nLastly, with three proposals committed towards this one e-Learning DAO plan, and their honest acknowledgement that they may need extra support in future funding rounds, I rate this proposal as 4 stars for feasibility. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a plan to develop the e-Learning DAO website with progress information. The process and timeline aligned with the action plan will be open to the public or Cardano community members interested via Github commits, pull requests and bug tracking. Through collaborating with outside agencies, including Snapbrillia, they will need to maintain this transparency throughout the project. \nThe main concern for me is the earning process. In the success criteria they\u2019ve listed that teachers, publishers, verifiers, and software developers receive income through DAO, with the learners being the ones paying the DAO into the system. Will this turn into the MIT of open-source, charging students an arm-and-a-leg to complete a course, or will the \u2018pool\u2019 of DAO be split very thin amongst the recipients? Clarity on how many students to \u2018break even\u2019 or how many students can support how many staff members would be vital to see this project maintain financial stability or even profitability without continuous topping up from Cardano.\nOverall, the auditability of the development process and timeline is strong, with just the concerns about the revenue model I give this proposal a 4 star rating for auditability. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Building a decentralised e-Learning platform through e-Learning DAO.\nFully open-source, community-owned and able to share revenues with content creators, teachers, verifiers and developers.", "experience": "22+ years in the IT industry which includes these fields:\n\nSoftware consulting for large enterprises and governments (Italy and UK)\nTech-Startup\nAI & Machine Learning\nOpen-source contribution\nEdTech\nResearch\nInternational patents\n\nProposals funded on Fund 7 and 8."}
