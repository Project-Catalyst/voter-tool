Like Cardano staking was run by federated IOHK-owned nodes in the past, and step-by-step gave it\u2019s block producing function to the SPOs, centralized services can decentralize with the help of DAO tools.

Token Creation will allow them and their legal team to review and suggest their learnings on how to create Tokens in the US jurisdiction which has been a large road-blocker for many. They also cover the issue of Token Staking and the Governance structures that need to come from the staking mechanic. With these proposal submissions and voting processes, we will likely also learn how to engage with a very active community at scale to help set a high standard of execution for other DAOs in the ecosystem.\n\nWith the DAO Challenge specifically focusing on making Cardano the go-to example for building a DAO, having the #1 Marketplace set the example for community engagement, well beyond what they have already done, seems to be a clear signal to broader blockchain communities. I believe the impact of having a well established company and team work on this is a great use of Catalyst funds specifically related to maximizing impact. Due to the large community, proven track record on transparency, collaboration, and execution I give this proposal a 5/5 rating.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "JPG Store and Blake (Founder) have been very open and engaged with the broader Cardano community as they have launched and built the marketplace. From hosting Twitter spaces addressing key concerns, often taking the feedback to reverse a decision they may have made too hastily even, shows me a level of empathy and engagement needed in building the initial framework for a DAO. \n\nFurthermore this direct access has given Blake a great name and the company rocketed to the #1 Marketplace on Cardano. With this broad of a reach (90%+ marketshare) it\u2019s likely the largest active community using an app on Cardano. They have reported ~2M unique active users to their site since their launch in January and consistently deliver new features with a rigorous engineering approach that often involves security audits by third party collaborators. \n\nThe milestones and team resources needed for this project are well within the expected timeline and needs for a project like this. \n\nA concern that I have seen from some in the community around existing (profitable) companies receiving funds seems unwarranted to me. The feasibility of this project being delivered to a high standard for the Cardano community is much higher because of their profitable status, along with excellent track record of product iteration and delivery. For these reasons I give this proposal a 5/5 rating.

The tactical implementation of providing visibility into the outcome of proposals is mostly a reporting and community update role, and I wish there would have been more details outlined here in how they would engage and share results with other teams trying to build out DAOs. \n\nUpon further personal discussion and encouragement to provide deeper docs - the JPG Store team has committed (review proposal comments) to providing a technical writeup and relevant engineering details. In the future I would like to see a bit more depth here for deliverables and accountability but also realize that with such an unknown undertaking this can be quite fuzzy to commit to. \n\nFinally the last metric that could have improved this proposal and the only reason I am giving a 4/5 rating, would be a measurable milestone aligning with the Challenge parameters that can be audited by the community. I would suspect that the best Challenge Key Metric for this would have been either Number of Communities engaged (NFT Projects for example) or Amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees.

The problem statement is presented as marketplaces are run in a centralized fashion, for which the solution proposed is to create a DAO for their own marketplace so users can have a voice in the direction of the store. The solution is divided in three main pillars, the creation and distribution of a token representing the share in the DAO\u2019s decision making, the governance platform where users will be able to present proposals and vote and a system of tokenomics to encourage the holding of the token itself. While the proposed solution is within the expected boundaries of a DAO\u2019s working mechanisms, is a little worrying the lack of thought put into the risk management.

The proposer team has addressed adoption and usage of end products (DAO NFT marketplace) as the main risks. Also as a recommendation to this proposal, they should also consider other risk possibilities ie. susceptibility to hacking and slowness in decision making. The project has high potential to scale as the  jpg.store community size is large enough to make the DAO adoption matter and create a potential success DAO user case. The team has foresee the future direction of jpg.store that it should empower its users, stakeholders and collaborators to have voice and control how they want the jpg.store community to evolve.

The majority of cost is related to employee costs ($8500/ week) and the overheads cost  ($2000/ week) already include unexpected delay, hosting, marketing cost and tutorial development. Although the proposal has requested quite a high amount of $63000 in implementing this project in the span of 6 weeks, it is understandable that they deploy 3 staff and the number of working hours per week per person makes sense.  I believe that it is highly likely that the proposal can be implemented successfully given the timeframe and their dedicated 3 team members (others are working on ad-hoc on the project). The team does not expect to return to future Catalyst funding round. One thing that is quite a major drawback of this proposal is that by looking at team members profile on their official website jpg.store, most team members have specified only their twitter profile with no professional background information. The feasibility of this JPG.store proposal could be improved if the team would be more transparent on which members are deployed on this project and elaborate more of their core functionality development in their milestones.

The team mentions proposal creation and active voting pool of > 50% user on approved proposal as KPIs. This exhibits that the jpg.store truly cares in delivering the impact of this proposal which is to integrate the DAO concept to the NFT marketplace and that means that the community participation in voicing opinion through voting does matter.
