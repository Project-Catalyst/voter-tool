The challenge question is \u201cHow can we make Cardano the go-to choice for building DAOs? What tools can we provide to enable effective DAO's Creation & Operation\u201d however; this proposal is not about tools to enable effective DAO\u2019s, but is instead a proposal to create a DAO with a specific purpose. The proposal idea may have a large positive impact on Cardano if launched successfully, but it is not clear how funding this proposal will be beneficial for other projects to build DAO\u2019s on Cardano. The proposal does not address a specific problem from the challenge that needs to be solved, and the goals of the proposal are not aligned with the challenge settings. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has described their relevant experience and education in computer science and background in real estate brokerage business. I don\u2019t think the proposer will be able to deliver this proposal as a single person team, and I would suggest they recruit more interested team members to help deliver on this vision. The proposal mentions a tech team that is yet to be hired, and a real estate team in Dubai that is not named. Furthermore there is no additional information provided on the proposer / team lead Tarun Karamchandani. The potential for this idea is very large, but there will be competition in this space, and a growing scope of legal considerations that I do not think have been adequately addressed in this proposal. I am concerned about the lack of information provided regarding the Artificially Intelligent valuation algorithm mentioned in this proposal, the legal considerations and complications, and the teams ability to deliver. I would suggest the proposer to further refine the details and information provided on these concerns. For these reasons I have given a rating of 2 out of 5 for feasibility. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The timeline includes: \u201cUsers can Start minting Real Estate Assets on PropX registry \nUsers can fractionally distribute ownership of assets\u201d  by the end of 2022. I believe this is an ambitious timeline that is unlikely to be achieved in 5-6 months, considering they will need to wait for funding, then hire the tech team, and begin building the platform. I believe the legal considerations alone will delay the delivery of this project significantly. This proposal is also very similar to one by the same proposer in fund 8 that requested $199,500 USD. This time in fund 9 it\u2019s not clear why the budget has changed to $87,000. The proposal should include a more \u201cunderstandable and effective solution that addresses the problem with measurable definitions of success\u201d. I would suggest including more specific and quantifiable metrics for the auditability of this proposal.

Furthermore, the impact of such a project if implemented correctly can be huge especially in cementing and improving the crypto community. On the other hand, this project seems to be more suitable for the 'Dapps, Products & Integrations' challenge where that challenge is more product-oriented. Also, the ability to scale here is pretty limitless due to the nature of the market this project targets, but that comes with its unique challenges.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the person behind the project claims to be an ex-employee of a crypto company ain a technical role. No relevant links were provided that would attest to that. Furthermore, the budget seems to be quite limited for such a complicated project. The nature of the projects also intersects with some legislative issue that is not considered seriously by the project. For instance, how would the ownership on the protocol level translate to legal ownership and control in real life? Such an issue is not trivial and would require laws to be passed in favor of a blockchain paradigm in real estate. The time frame is also not very detailed with clear planning of what would be done in terms of implementation.

On the other hand, the legal matters and real-life implementation hurdles are not put into consideration which means that the community will find it hard to follow up on this project.

Although the proposal goes into great detail on the different functionalities that the DAO will provide to the community, this is not a small challenge which is being worked on by a several established companies in the real estate industry. The main challenges were identify already by the team in the proposal under the main risks that could prevent the delivery of the project. Those being the lack of reliable data oracles that handle this type of information, the huge amount of liquidity that would be needed to address their property swap functionality and the legal ramifications of operating a decentralized organization which provides real estate services across many different jurisdictions.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal presents a detailed plan, including timeline and key milestones. Although it might be a bit ambitious in my opinion given the amount of work that needs to be put into building the main pillars of the project from the ground up. For example, instead of building the data oracles from scratch some time should be put into researching what\u2019s already available. Since no more information was provided in the proposal other than the whitepaper, it\u2019s hard to assess if there\u2019s already something built regarding the back end of the DAO. The only team member identified is Tarun Karamchandani, for whom no LinkedIn or personal portfolio of past developments was provided. Given that he is the only identified member, it\u2019s my opinion that at the moment there\u2019s no assembled team behind this ambitious project. The budget breakdown is not detailed enough to analyze if the proposal is feasible. Given the ambitious timeline, the full stack blockchain developer and the haskell developer should already be identified.

Real Estate is known to be an illiquid and reserved for privilege asset class. By democratizing and tokenization of real estate, the platform features allow instant swap users' real estate to ADA and fractional owership of real estate. The proposal also covers very detailed on its other potential features ie. auction, rental, decentralized mortgage, decentralized insurance, inheritance and global trading etc. Within the PropX DAO itself, a variety of these communities could evolve on its own. The proposer also shares important risks for this project namely the trustworthy of decentralized oracle networks, liquidity generation and legal status of DAOs.

This could be a monumental change for the real estate market. There are clear benefits for turning deeds of real estate into nfts. This could drive down costs for the average owner. The additional elements of insurance, mortgages, and rent would all be huge benefits to Cardano. I would love to see this project move forward. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The problem with this proposal is that it does not acknowledge once (even in the white paper) that real estate is a heavily regulated industry. Each state has its own real estate, lending, and rental laws as well as each country. There are real issues involved in the transfer of real estate, including but not limited to; water rights, city planning zones, deed issues, property ownership issues, etc. Each of these issues are managed each time a deed is transferred, and if not, there is title insurance that ensures the title is free and clear upon transfer. This proposal does not offer a suggestion or solution for problems. I.E. I sell my property to the DAO, how does the DAO verify I have the legal rights to sell my property? Once a clear deed is in the DAO, how do they ensure that it remains clear? How will property taxes be addressed? What about income tax from sales or property? These are all significant details that are not mentioned in the proposal. This leads to assuming the team does not in fact have the requisite experience in real estate to ensure the success of this project.

How will they ensure compliance with local, state, national, and international real estate laws? The US has strict regulation regarding real estate purchases by outside agents, especially since 9/11. How will these be mitigated. Since there is no mention of these issues in the audit section, this proposal would not be successfully auditable. Sadly, I would love to see something like this become a reality, but until the legal issues are addressed, there is no chance of success for a DAO of this nature.
