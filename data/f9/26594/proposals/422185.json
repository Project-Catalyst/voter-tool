Today\u2019s health care system focuses on only disease and doesn\u2019t seek a holistic approach or a health optimization.", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 4.541666666666666, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1717, "q0": "In terms of impact, this proposal is good, but I would like to know in more detail how Cardano's technologies would be used. The problem to be work is the way the health and wellness system works today, focusing only on the disease and not on the human being; proponents suggest a more holistic approach to this problem, promoting health optimization. The focus is to generate a platform, which would be a DAO, called ADAweel. It would be fully focused on promoting health through this alternative approach. I thought the idea was very important, necessary and current, as it is a fact that nowadays we tend to search for diseases and symptoms on the internet, on unreliable sites, which can generate several harms. For example, these sites support themselves through advertisements and abusive propagation (we are required to read an advertisement to continue browsing or otherwise provide cookies). The information passed on these sites is often dubious, as proponents state: \u201csome may even contain false medical information that tricks consumers into purchasing 'snake oil' medical treatments. Proponents also raise the problem of lack of time and interest in looking for more reliable and complete information (\u201cThe popularization of science is on the rise like never before. But not everyone has the time or interest to read medical journals and journals, listen to podcasts from 2 to 3 hours or consume other types of scientific materials\u201d). So the ADAwell platform would work precisely on top of these 3 problems, as is clear in the excerpt: \u201cfunction 1 - Curation and Synthesis (Performing a role in this proposal) + role 2 - Events and Challenges (Performance in the future) + role 3 - Support ( running in the future)\u201d. The amount requested for this proposal is low as it would only correspond to the DAO proof of concept. I think this choice is very smart because it increases the chances of the project being financed and continuing to be built. The proponents also define what activities would make up the curation and synthesis session, such as selecting materials from reliable sources, establishing contacts with experts, etc. There would be tool kits, and each kit would correspond to, respectively, the preventive health part: prioritizing exams and treatments, such as reading labels, keeping personal health records, communicating with your doctor, listening to your body signals, and finally, when and how (protocols) will help you optimize your diet. In summary, the objective of this phase is super clear, as it brings together like-minded people about science and well-being. The problem here is that it is not so clear how blockchain technologies would be used. Some statements are made: \u201cADAwell intends to become a Cardano DAO. The tools needed for DAOs are currently lacking, but under development.\u201d What tools would these be? The proponents' own preposition, \u201chow to turn ADAwell into a community-oriented wellness DAO in Cardano\u201d, is not answered directly. How can we be sure that the amount of Ada and smart contracts will be increased? That the number of active community members will grow through this project? Therefore, I think this technical part should have been explored further, in order to provide a better understanding of the bridge between Cardano and the ADAwell project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal does have some positive points in relation to how the applicability of the project would be made, but some things could improve here. The script starts well - we know a lot of activities that would happen in August; it would be interesting if there were more details about them, for example where the \u201cSLEEP TOOLKITS\u201d would be published and how the user manual would be made, who would work on this part and in what way. In September we also have several activities listed and the same thing happens - the level of detail could be better, we don't know how the AMA session would be planned and carried out - in fact, it's not clear what it is; how would the contact with wellness professionals be made, how would they get to know the project, understand how Cardano gets involved (would it be presented to them about blockchain or just the part more focused on health and well being?). As of October, activities are punctuated less accurately, as we know that in the last 3 months meetings would be held with the community - but we do not know what content would be addressed and how often these meetings would be held - nor are we told how the The community would be engaged in participating in these moments and would \u201cbuy into the idea\u201d, that is, how they would understand and embark on this initiative (because many people have a very rigid view of health, how to demystify the subject?). For these reasons, I think the script tells us more generally about what's going to happen, but without the level of detail that I think is ideal. The total amount requested is divided into two parts: the cost of digital tools and the DAO platform, community and building. The first part is more detailed, we know how the 690 dollars would split more precisely, but the remaining 5000 dollars is explained very superficially. It is said that \u201cThe remainder of the budget is for implementing the proposal, valued at 1000 USD/month. This fee will allow me to work full-time at ADAwell for the duration of the proposal, August through December.\u201d But it's not clear how the thousand dollars a month would be used because a series of tasks would go in here, would this amount be shared equally between the two people presented in the team part? Because in this case, the value is very low (500 dollars for full-time work); doubt is in the air. Finally, talking about the presentation of the team, the information about the duo Adalat Raimova and ChaKhan is passed on in a very satisfactory way, because we know in detail, who they are, what their professional areas are, we are provided with their linkedin profiles, etc. ; in other words, we have a great degree of detail so that we get to know them with a lot of understanding, what worries me is in relation to their experience with Cardano, apparently only ChaKhan has studies in the blockchain area and we don't know if he studied it more generally or focused on Cardano. It would be important to have that understanding. That said, some improvements could still be made, the topic is ok.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The way proponents suggest that progress be measured is quite adequate, they report a series of metrics that should be evaluated, such as the number of toolkits and pages managed; visitors and viewing on the Obsidian page; Discord community tracking and etc. It could have been better explained how some of these KPIs would be analyzed, in the case of qualitative factors, such as the twitter analysis. What parameters would you use to run this analysis, how would you plan to track the Discord community - would you analyze the volume of ideas exchanged, conversations and engagement? How can this all be analyzed and more details? It's good that they announce that they will post all updates on Discord, but we would need to know how often this would be done. Weekly, monthly? And how would updates be made, would there be a checklist and be scored? It would also be necessary for us to know a little about the work routine of the professionals involved, in the case of the pair, what they would be doing each month, if the activities that were programmed in the script were actually being carried out, etc. That's why I think it's necessary that the updates are monthly and also made in order to understand about the accomplishment of the tasks and about the partial results, not just one or the other. The success scenario here would not correspond to the complete closure of the project, as the requested budget and activities would focus on carrying out only an initial phase; even so, the proponents tell us what would be considered success for this phase; which would be \u201ccuration and synthesis toolkits (Sleep, Eye health, Homo Sedens) were published, more than 100 views each, receive more than 3 positive feedbacks from people who have benefited from it\u201d, in addition to the growth of the ADAwell community and the greater involvement of the Cardano community with the project, requesting a curatorship on a health topic - would this be done in the created dApp, discord\u2026? Anyway, the main objective is to unite the ADAwell + Cardano community around health and well being. I think it would be important for all this data to be collected and exposed to our community; I think the most suitable format would be an online meeting, or on Zoom, or in an after Townhall space (or even in the main meeting)... objectives were achieved as well as the specific objectives of this challenge. For these reasons, I think the auditability is good, but it's not 100% perfect, a little bit of depth would be welcome.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 987, "q0": "### GENERAL\nThis is a community building proposal aiming to lay the contextual foundation to tackle very real and serious issues within the health & wellness economy.\nThe great solution summary, takes into account that a DAO can't simply by created, but has to be formed by a unified vision of a community engaging with it. \n\n- missing: cognitive security, spiritual / shadow / inner work?\n\n(!) suggestion to look into SociaDesignAcademy (SDA) and the conversational UI toolkit they're building.

It is also a bit unclear of how exactly the DAO element of the platform will be created, since there are not any technical explanations in this regard in the proposal. That said, this proposal only asks for funding for minimal resources to kickstart this procedure and they have mentioned we might see future proposals that cover further parts of this mission. Therefore, based on the budget, which is broken down clearly and mainly consist of fixed licensing costs and work for 1 person, their plan for this proposal seem very sensible.

One problem I found with your plan is that having ADAwell could discourage people to see doctors because they feel they can handle their own problems. All health professionals have different views and seeing something on screen may look different than seeing something in person. A soloution to this problem would be putting ADAwell stations in medical centres so, if it's something serious than proffesionals will be there to have a look themselves. The 3rd stage is where there will be a series of challenges to help people get fit and healthy however this is very reward orientated and if there is not specific evidence on how this will help the body then going on a diet (for example) could end up making some participants very sick.

The system that the team chose for ADAwell is a dicord server but you can oly do so much as look at a person instead of all that testing you would do down at a medical centre. This, I think is not the best of choices because of the screen. Looking at a screen is very bad for your eyes and ADAwell is encouraging this yet it is a wellbeing platform. However, this is unavoidable and something that could help is monthly fun runs or yoga groups where the participants can also get monthly checkups while being outdoors, not on their phones.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the sucess of the proposal. The milestones provided are sufficient to evaluate the progress but will require quite a lot of time to get accurate results. Nevertheless, an experienced auditor will be required to make sure the results on ADAwells progress are right. On the first step of success it says that more than 100 views on a topic and more than 3 positive reviews however, it is impossible to know that these reviews are actually true. For all the team knows, ADAwell could be doing terribly and someone could be lying. This, I think is important as if the first step of success has happened then the team will think that it's time to move on to step 2 which will require more team members which will in turn mean that they will require more funding. A way to solve this problem is to make it a private discord server and invite people who the team trusts so the community will build at a slower pace but they can trust the success.
