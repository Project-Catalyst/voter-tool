How many sessions/hours. What is the cost of DAO creation going to? What are the metrics that are going to be accomplished by this amount of funding? And for the timeline? What exactly does it take to create a DAO? What is the plan? How will new members be onboarded? Through marketing, as there is a substantial marketing budget, but how? Google ads? Something more targeted? This is a huge part of whether or not this is feasible. As an assessor, without these details, I cannot determine and so the score is a 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As it relates to the budget, there are a lot of missing measurables. With a budget of $15,000 toward marketing, there should be more metrics to ascertain effectiveness of the ad spend. If creating content, then what are the engagement levels with that content? If ads, what is the ROI, or funnel results of that ad? These are questions that would be very useful to auditors of the proposal. The big goal is clear. The desire to grow communities of southeast Asians who are part of Cardano-DAOs is a good goal, and measuring the overall results is good.

Countries in South East Asia like India have a large pool of untapped potential (given to the population size), especially when it comes to IT and tech. It has an excellent atmosphere for technology to thrive (given that it is a popular tech hub), with many individuals aspiring to limited roles. The educational systems focus on the theoretical aspects of a subject, but lacks the translation to practical sphere; educational institutions do teach but fail to elucidate the reasoning and fail to create a nexus between theoretical and practical know how. This project identifies the need of the Cardano ecosystem, creates a nexus (not just between developers and ecosystems but also additional upskilling which is essential for Haskell aka Plutus) and manages to address the said need, creating a win win situation for all parties involved. The use case of Haskell-Plutus is rampant within the blockchain system and creating a platform where people with similar technical knowledge are able to communicate and ideate without borders creates a borderless interactive avenue for skills to grow. This in turn is beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem and other blockchain ecosystems; they have a pretrained set of of skilled individuals who understand the practical applications of Haskell at their disposal implying that upscaling the chain would be convenient. This project is able to address not just current challenges but also future challenges that come in hand with development.\n\nThe rewards mechanism adequately answers the risk; namely why should a developer build on an particular system as opposed to some other ecosystem. It appears that they have the the required resources prepared and merely need funding to realize the proposal, implying that they have the requisite upskilling mechanism in place and have adequate ways to weed out sub par efforts from developers (for eg. having trainers who specialize in Haskell and Haskell use case, incentivizing  pro active developers, creating a space for free flow of ideas, etc. )\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer seems to have enough knowledge and experience to seamlessly implement the project.

Their two phased approach properly lists out their game plan; for eg. their first step would be to onboard developers locally and then expand to other South East Asia regions and Encourage the development of talent across the South-Asian community and amalgamate as a broad non-technical DAO. The funding appears to be adequate as they have made a provision of ancillary expenses. A greater detailed breakdown of the budget would be better, since there seems to be vagueness.
