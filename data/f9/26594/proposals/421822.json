The budget seems to be reasonable to achieve the set goals. The proposer provided a project roadmap, detailed in 6 phases however there is no timeline provided for each phase or project completion.\n\nThe only identified risk is the reliance on Blockfrost API and the team will reach out to Blockfrost API to mitigate that risk.\n\nGiven the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provided a roadmap with milestones but not a time horizon for achievement.

The proposal provides a plan consisting of 6 phases, in which we know what tasks will be performed. Unfortunately, it's not tied to timelines, so we can't imagine how long these phases will take, and when this project will start and end. Next on budget, the total required budget is $12,000 broken down into easily auditable chunks. However, according to my objective assessment, the salary of 150$/hour is quite high compared to other projects.

What's missing from this section is how the community can track this project. I have a suggestion that, at the end of each month, proponents give an overview, next to the goals achieved, as well as how their mode of operation. These reports can be provided in a simple document that the Cardano community should be made aware of through any of our means of communication, such as telegrams, discord, etc.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2917, "q0": "On-chain governance portal that is easy to implement on wordpress website can be very userful for new and exiting DAOs on Cardano.

Such a solution has a potential large impact for extending the outreach of Cardano Governance, as Wordpress has a market share of 43% of all websites.

The rate is high, but judging by the final price of the product and by the skills required to carry out the project, the cost is reasonable. \n\nGiven there is already a working beta, it is reasonable that no implementation risk is mentioned.

However, the lack of delivery dates makes it harder for the community to check the progress. \n\nSince the public beta is already available, I consider installing and using the beta as a concrete form of audit that the community can perform. \n\nThe team provides very clear KPIs to let the community know how to measure the success of the plugin: number of installations, and number of users engaging with the voting platform. \n\nThe proposal does not mention any delivery date. Even in case the team considers the public beta already delivered, I would suggest providing a date signaling the community when the development efforts will be completed and when the product is available. \n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2548", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12982, "q0": "The proposal is about Making a platform where users may directly vote on chains without even having technical understanding .
