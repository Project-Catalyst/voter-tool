I say this because the problem reported is very current and more common than one might imagine, in the cryptographic world people often have good technical knowledge regarding the technologies that are being developed, such as programming languages, smart contracts, etc.; but they don't have as much knowledge about the legal part of things. So what is said here is, to address the situation where \u201cprojects that want to operate as a DAO, there is no easy way to understand the legal and implementation risks and the ways to operate as a compliant DAO\u201d, proponents will create a platform through which DAO members can consult different jurisdictions regarding the matter. Reports would be published in a virtual, interactive environment, an implementation that would be provided by the DLT360 group. Right at the beginning I thought it was very positive that this proposal is provided in partnership with the ClearContracts group with DLT360, because they are well known already in Catalyst, having some funded proposals and already being well established in the community. So in theory, the project is perfect: providing legal guidance to teams that have DAOs or want to develop one; from the moment they are better oriented in this sense, they will have a fertile and safe ground to develop their activities, I really believe that this initiative is super necessary and beneficial for our ecosystem - because, as I already mentioned, many times professionals in the area of technology do not hire lawyers or do not seek to educate themselves so adequately on this type of aspect, so that they come to be heavily harmed during the execution of their projects and activities. I have some considerations to make, some doubts to raise. When proponents state they will \u201coffer clear guidance on how to incorporate and operate as a compliant DAO in the United States and other jurisdictions. We will create a comprehensive report and maps of challenges, risks and opportunities from a legal and implementation perspective in our interactive implementation compass (provided by DLT360)\u201d; How would these guidelines be made, exactly? How would interactive implementation work? It would be interesting if we could see a preview of this tool, how would the bridge between such legal guidelines and the Cardano community be made? Would the laws of every state in the country be searched? Probably yes, but it would be good to have that certainty. I also think that this solution should be expanded to other jurisdictions, from countries where there are a greater number of DAOs (here is a suggestion for a possible continuation of the proposal). Another question that came to me was regarding the phrase \u201cwe will press for community contribution and collaboration to build this structure by collecting data through surveys sent to DAO members in the Cardano ecosystem and the wider blockchain ecosystem\u201d: why other networks of blockchain would also be part of the survey if the objective is to benefit Cardano specifically? Apart from that, it is also positive how the proponents raise the risk of lack of legal certainty and how it could be resolved (through constant research). In general, the proposal deserves a maximum score in impact because the project is super important and beneficial, although some doubts were generated during its reading.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This thread is fine, but not as good as the previous one. The script is a little confusing because the activities are divided into weeks, it is a little confusing if, for example, from week 1 to week 3 the said activities would be done (Legal: Research the US jurisdiction + Practical: data collection research provided to DAO creators for information on how individuals/organizations create DAOs now); or if these activities would only be done in week 1, and the project would be paused in week 2 to be resumed in week 3. The activities would probably happen continuously between the weeks, but this would need to be better defined. It is also confusing why the proponents include the jurisdiction of France and Germany in the research roadmap, when in the impact part they say that the project would be developed with a focus on the United States. So there would be an extension to Europe as well? Another thing: more detail could have been provided on what would be done, how these researches would be carried out, how the study would be carried out, what the daily work of lawyers would be like; as well as the practical and more technological part that concerns the construction of the interactive tool built by DLT360, we also don't have a detail about it - in fact it is planned to be done in just 2 weeks (from week 10 to 12, at that I understand); Would it be a relatively simple tool to be developed in that short time frame? In short, the script is just ok, as it gives us an overview of what would happen and when, but the \u201chow\u201d factor is left out, due to the absence of details. The financial amount requested is very consistent with the structure and size of the project, and is explained in a very direct way, I would also like it to be a little better argued. Basically we have 3 parts, the payment for the research itself, for the development and implementation and for meetings with the lawyers. How many meetings would there be, what would the price of each be? How long would the meetings last? It would be very positive if we had a better understanding of how many there would be and also what subjects would be debated. The other expenses are better explained because we know the value of the work hour, the more detail that could be said is how many hours each professional of the team would dedicate here, so we would know the exact value that each one would receive working for this project and we would have better ability to judge whether it is fair or not. Finally, the team presentation part is the best part of this topic; we are duly introduced to the lawyers (Maury Shenk and Jonas Weinberher); as well as the technology team: Logan Panchot, Justin Schreiner and Shannon Wu. It is extremely positive how they report their training and previous experiences, and especially the fact that we have people very involved with Cardano, conveying confidence about their preparation to deal with our blockchain technologies. For these reasons, feasibility is good, but could improve in terms of roadmap and budget explanation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is average, could still improve. Progress would be measured by some suggested KPIs, such as jurisdictions surveyed, interactions on the platform that was built, lawyers contacted, DAOs that used the survey and tools, etc. However, it is unclear how the project development process would be monitored; what we have here are the partial results that would have to be realized over time, but we don't know how to monitor the activities that would be behind that, that would result in that. Therefore, it is necessary for some team member to do this behind-the-scenes analysis, let's say, and be able to update the Cardano community accurately and with some regularity (for example, at the latest at the end of each month). Unfortunately, the part of the auditability of the progress is to be desired because the focus is very much on what would be done, but not on how, if the platform's research/development hours were being worked out correctly, if the meetings with the lawyers were happening as planned, if they were being as fruitful as thought and so on. A more comprehensive study would need to be done and all this needs to be passed on directly to our community members. As the DLT360 group is already well established at Cardano, they probably have a communication channel, like a discord channel, for example. Monthly reports could be posted there that said what was being worked on. I also think that the perception of success is not so good, because the proponents focus much more on quantitative data than qualitative. For example, the number of jurisdictions surveyed would have to be 10 in the first month, 30 in the second and 100 in the third. The number of lawyers involved and DAOs is also raised. But how could we understand more precisely, in practice, the consequences of this project? Even though proponents have defined success as \u201ccommunities and organizations that want to operate as a DAO have a reputable source for understanding the path to operating as a compliant DAO\u201d, this is a bit generic. My suggestion is that, after the interactive tool is launched for some time, a direct survey is carried out with DAOs (whether they are already formed or construction), so that it is possible to understand how this project has been beneficial for them, how it contributed to a more and assertive in its activities, in which way it was a factor that potentiated the success and growth of organizations. Once we had this feedback collected, we could understand more clearly whether the challenge objectives were met. For these reasons I believe that auditability is a principle, it is the beginning of how the project can be properly monitored, but it is not yet fully compliant.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 658, "q0": "This proposal addresses a clear need for the community to be better prepared to operate legally within various jurisdictions. The challenge is specific to dealing with this issue regarding DAOs by providing legal research to help DAO founders and governance understand legal requirements. The proposal partly addresses the challenge by providing undoubtedly useful information to DAOs however the challenge is mostly about creating tools and features that set Cardano DAOs apart from others. This type of legal navigation information would have been ideal for the \"Legal and financial implications\" challenge. With that said the proposal still does fit the challenge even if somewhat imperfectly in my view. Importantly it helps solve a real problem that needs solutions and the proposal would provide a great deal of value since it's cost is very reasonable. Additionally the information would be made available openly to the entire community and therefore would have a very wide reach. I agree the answer covers most of the criteria and that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team for this project has good credentials which are applicable to the goals of the proposal. The DLT360 team's information is easily verifiable on their website and both DLT360 and Clear Contracts teams have provided enough information in the proposal to show that they are more than qualified to perform this task. The DLT360 team has been funded past proposals in catalyst and has other proposals submitted but the scope of this proposal is relatively small and does not pose a concern in terms of resourcing. The resources required for this proposal are realistic and a very detailed an clear set of goals with timeframes have been listed. There is also an understanding that there may not be answers to many of the legal questions asked since DAOs are new and legal clarity may not be established in many jurisdictions. This is acknowledged and there is a plan to provide general guidance in these events. Overall this task seems very well suited to the proposers and I see no concerns in terms of feasibility therefore I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has a very through roadmap with several milestones and established timeframes. The KPIs used for auditability are listed and they make sense to evaluate the success of this proposal. One KPI that may be difficult to track is the number of DAOs that will use the research information provided by the team. How this would be accomplished was not explained but otherwise the KPIs are relatively straightforward, quantitative measurements and should be easy to report on. If I had one suggestion for the teams here for future proposals would be to clearly articulate how the reporting on the KPIs will be shared with the community. This could be as simple as a quick progress report on a website. Overall I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2113", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1485, "q0": "DLT360 and ClearContracts offer a poignant solution to the impending problems many up and coming DAOs will face in order to comply with regulatory frameworks across the morass of geopolitical boundaries.

It seems unlikely that anything Cardano-specific will make this legal advice more applicable to our ecosystem than potential beneficiaries on Ethereum DAOs. As the DLT360 Risk & Opportunity Radar website is only \"Currently open for Pilot Clients\", I hope that this report and radar would be available free of charge to our community DAOs if this project is funded by Catalyst. As one of the project's goals is that the research will be used by 100 DAOs, so I think it will be.
